""" Problem Description:
When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle.
In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. For example:
There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25.
There will also be a string.
Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm2 assuming all letters are 1mm wide.
