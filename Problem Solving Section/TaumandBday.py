""" Problem Description:
Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha.
There are two types of gifts that Diksha wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white.
To make her happy, Taum has to buy b black gifts and  white gifts.

The cost of each black gift is bc units.
The cost of every white gift is wc units.
The cost to convert a black gift into white gift or vice versa is z units.
Determine the minimum cost of Diksha's gifts.
