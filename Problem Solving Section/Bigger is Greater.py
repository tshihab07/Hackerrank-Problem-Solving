""" Problem Description:
Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.
Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:
- It must be greater than the original word
- It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition.
